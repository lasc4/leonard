                In early 2017, Young Dolph was allegedly the target of gunfire in Charlotte, North Carolina. According to Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, on February 25, several dozen rounds were fired. Allegedly two or more vehicles and several weapons were involved, with rounds striking nearby residences and vehicles. By the next day, several hip-hop news agencies had begun reporting that Young Dolph was the primary target of the shooting, and that, perhaps, 100 rounds were fired during the attack. It was speculated that the shooting had stemmed from a rivalry between Dolph and rapper Yo Gotti, though both parties have remained silent. Young Dolph took advantage of the publicity of the alleged shooting to promote his second studio album Bulletproof.</li>
